This problem happens once you hit 25 reports total.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Don't worry, your reports are still being submitted, and we can see them over here -- they just aren't showing up in the app.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>We will be publishing a major update to the app shortly. It includes a fix for this issue and many other new features.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Thanks to everybody for using the app and giving us feedback!"
