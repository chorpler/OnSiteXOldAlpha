Hello. We are testing the OnSite app and you have been invited to join the test group.

IF YOU HAVE AN ANDROID
If you have an Android phone, please click here:

from your phone to go to the app's beta testing page on the Google Play store. Click on "Become a tester" to join the testing program. It may require you to log in with your Google Play account if you are not already logged in on your phone. Once it says "You are now a tester," you can click the link under that to install the app from the Google Play store like any app.


IF YOU HAVE AN IPHONE
If you have an iPhone, please click here:
https://nano.sesa.us/mydevices
to open Safari. You should see a login page.
- Log in with your SESA username and password. The passwords have all been set to "sesa1234" for now. Your SESA username is usually the first part of your @sesafleetservices.com e-mail address.

- Once login is complete, you will see a picture of your iPhone. Click the "Enroll" button below it.

- Click on "Install" to enroll your device.

- After enrolling, click on the "Profiles" tab. Then click on the "Install" button next to "Trust Profile for SESA". Install this to let the app run on your phone and for updates to be installed.

- After you install the trust profile, the app will automatically be downloaded and installed within a few minutes. You will see a notice of this and it will ask you if you want to allow it. Say yes and the app will be installed.
