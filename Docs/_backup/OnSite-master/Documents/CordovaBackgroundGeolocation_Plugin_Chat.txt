Correct me if my understanding is wrong, but all the source code we get is for the plugin and not for the iOS/Android library that does the native functionality?
Javascript

We've been doing Javascript MVC UI a long time. We're particularly fond of Sencha's Touch & ExtJS but we also like Google's Angular a lot.

Mobile

Cordova's new plugin architecture is great. We've contributed a number of custom plugins ourselves, especially background-geolocation.

Server

We spend a lot of time with Nodejs, Ruby/Rails, Heroku, EC2. We created the ruby Gem sencha-model interfacing Sencha with ActiveRecord.

 Chatting with Chris.
Hi! Can we answer a question for you?
VisitorHeh. That was a startling, but pretty cool, popup of you when I came to the transistorsoft site.

Please stand by

Chris has joined the chat!
Chrisyea, that's automated.
VisitorI was actually coming to get your e-mail address to send you a question, but hey, this is pretty handy!
Chrisare you a current customer?
VisitorI have a premium license for the Background Geolocation plugin (starmobiledevelopers)
Chrislemme guess: you can't access the repo?
VisitorAnd I was just curious -- is there a .... heh heh ... no, I have no problem there.
As far as I know.
Chrisyea, you're good
question?
VisitorI've been meaning to ask you for a while -- is there a way to customize what gets saved to SQLite / uploaded to the configured address? I'd like to include some user data.
I mean, I could presumably do it in the callback, but you've already set up a pretty awesome system.
ChrisbgGeo.setConfig({params: {user_id: App.getUser().getId()}})
VisitorExcellent. Thanks for the tip!
ChrisI like to add cordova.device info to my params

}
bgGeo.setConfig({params: {device: cordova.device}})
VisitorYes, I plan to include that too. Although I may end up switching to my own UUID for each device, depending on how well the ng-persist add-on works at actually persisting despite app uninstall/reinstall cycles...
At least, for the iOS folk.
Now that the device ID changes every time you uninstall every app from a vendor, as I understand it.
ChrisDid you buy the "Premium Support"?
http://shop.transistorsoft.com/products/copy-of-cordova-background-geolocation-premium-license-basic-support
VisitorNo, just the cheaper version. But my client may end up authorizing that too. They're supposed to have lots of oil money.
ChrisOk. you don't get to talk to me on this channel until you do
