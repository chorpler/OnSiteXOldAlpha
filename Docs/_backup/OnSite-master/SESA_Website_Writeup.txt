Oilfield work sites are harsh environments, and when in service; equipment is running 24/7. Unfortunately, with all the things going on at such a busy place, it can be easy to overlook things like preventive maintenance. And taking equipment away from the jobsite to be serviced costs time and money. But in the long run, equipment that doesn't get maintained will cost more, and not just in  money -- poorly maintained equipment is unsafe and underperforms.  

SESA Fleet Services is the solution to this problem.

Founded in May 2005 by Tino Vela, SESA brings customer service right to our customers in Mexico and the United States. Instead of having to stop work and bring trucks and heavy equipment in for service and diagnostics, our clients stay put and SESA's technicians come to them. It may not be an ordinary way of doing business in today's world, but SESA believes customer service should be extraordinary.

SESA continues to develop better protocols organizationally in order to increase productivity for our customers. We are dually committed to our team of experienced technicians who are the backbone of our company by providing continual training and many other benefits afforded by a young agile company.  

As SESA grows, we are aggressively developing new as well as existing technologies which will further improve our customer's productivity: Fleet Asset Management, and mobile applications for our technicians.  These again will increase productivity as well as provide better service scheduling resulting in equipment being better maintained and running at greater than industry standard uptime.
