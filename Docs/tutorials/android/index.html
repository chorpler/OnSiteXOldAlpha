<h1>SESA OnSiteX for Android</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Please tap the following link from Chrome on your phone:</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.sesaonsite.onsitex">https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.sesaonsite.onsitex</a></p></li>

<li><p>This will take you to the Google Play store page for the version of OnSite we are currently testing. In order to install the app (or any app from the Play Store), you will need to be logged in to your Google Play account. If you are not logged in, you will see a login request, similar to this:</p>
<img src="ss024.jpg"></li>

<li><p>Log in with your Google account username and password. Then you will see a screen asking if you want to become a tester for the app. Tap on the "BECOME A TESTER" button.</p>
<img src="ss001.jpg" /></li>

<li><p>You are now registered to test the OnSite app:</p>
<img src="ss002.jpg" /></li>

<li><p>At the bottom of the page you will see "You are now a tester" and a link below that which says "Download the SESA OnSiteX app on Google Play". Tap that link.</p>
<img src="ss003.jpg" /></li>

<li><p>You may be asked if you want to open the link with the Play Store app, if you haven't done this before. Click "Always" so you won't see this message again.</p>
<img src="ss004.jpg" /></li>

<li><p>The Google Play Store page for OnSite will be shown. Note that it says "Unreleased" and says "This app is in development. It may be unstable." This is because we are still testing the app, but it is nothing to be concerned about. Tap on the green "INSTALL" button.</p>
<img src="ss005.jpg" /></li>

<li><p>Google Play will tell you the permissions the app requires. Tap on "ACCEPT".</p>
<img src="ss006.jpg" /></li>

<li><p>The app will download and install.</p>
<img src="ss007.jpg" /></li>

<li><p>You will then see an icon for OnSiteX on your phone:</p>
<img src="ss008.jpg" /></li>

<li><p>Tap the icon and OnSite will start up:</p>
<img src="ss009.jpg" /></li>

<li><p>If your phone lock screen does not have a password, PIN number, or swipe pattern set, you will get a "SECURITY TOO LOW" message as the phone tries to log in to our server. Android phones require that your phone be secured in order to use hardware encryption to store your login information. This is a good idea, but you can tap on CANCEL if you don't want to secure your phone right now. (If you hit CANCEL, you can skip to step 14 now.) If you want to secure your phone, tap on OK.</p>
<img src="ss010.jpg" /></li>

<li><p>You will be taken to the Security Settings page for your phone, which will tell you to add a password or PIN in order to store credentials (login information). You can still choose CANCEL at this point, but we recommend you tap OK. Then follow your phone's instructions to set a lock screen password, PIN number, or swipe pattern.</p>
<img src="ss011.jpg" /></li>

<li><p>Once you have set security, or chosen not to secure your phone, the app will show you the login screen.</p>
<img src="ss012.jpg" /></li>

<li><p>Enter your SESA account information. Unless you have a custom avatar name, this will usually be the first part of your @sesafleetservices.com e-mail, most often your first initial and last name. All passwords are <span class="pass">sesa1234</span> for now.</p>
<img src="ss013.jpg" /></li>

<li><p>You are now logged in and can use the app to submit work reports.</p>
