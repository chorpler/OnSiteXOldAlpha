The most important number(s) are the number of hours you worked and the total hours for the pay period (Wednesday through Tuesday of shifts 1 through 7).</p>\n\n<p>The number of hours submitted is the total of all shift hours submitted: this number is what will be used to calculate the hours in your paycheck.</p>\n\n<p>Payroll Hours are the hours calculated from your hours submitted. This is the number of hours you should be paid for in your paycheck. However, payroll hours displayed here are UNVERIFIED hours.</p>\n\n<p>If you made a mistake and sent <b>too many hours</b>, then do not expect to see all of those hours on your paycheck.</p>\n\n<p>If you have submitted <b>too few hours</b>, it is your responsibility to correct them by submitting the appropriate work reports. <b>You will not be paid for hours not submitted (hours not reported).</b></p>\n\n<p>Too few hours do not trigger a flag.</p>\n\n<p>If you submit too many hours, an exception for that shift will be marked with a red flag.</p>\n\n<p>It is <b>your</b> responsibility to make sure you document all hours worked.
